;; This module provides a naive stack, from which either a single item
;; may  be page-pushed or a "major" item.  When page-popping, either a single
;; item may be page-popped or all the items down to just before the last
;; major item.  The implementation uses #f to delimit major items, so
;; that cannot be used as a regular item.
