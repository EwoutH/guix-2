This patch fixes 100% reproducible test failures on arm-linux-gnueabihf in our
the build environment chroot, as reported at <https://bugs.gnu.org/26253>,
and now on x86_64-linux-gnu as well.  It is a variant of this upstream patch:

      tests: avoid false ulimit failure on some systems

      * tests/misc/cut-huge-range.sh: On some systems returns_ may
      use more memory, so incorporate that in the determination
      of the ulimit value to use.  Noticed on ARMv7 with bash-4.4.12,
      and x86_64 with bash-4.2.37.
      Fixes http://bugs.gnu.org/26253

... which appeared to be insufficient.
